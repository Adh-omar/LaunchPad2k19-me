Ribbon

The Problem:
Students can't get work because they dont have work experience and can't get work experience because they can't get work

The Solution:
Ribbon. Connects small startups to students who are willing to do tasks for free or a small fee in exchange for work experience
and a reference to put on their CV.

Example:
As small coffee shop wants to redesign their logo but doesn't have the resources to hire a full IT position to design a logo. So they
get in touch with a graphic design student willing to do it for free so that they can get work experience and be more employable.
